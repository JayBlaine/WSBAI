The model trains off of the dataset linked above. The .csv file is also included in this repository for ease of use. 

Runtime -> Run All will not work due to asynchronous constraints from the PRAW scraping code cell.
So long as the reddit_wsb.csv file is in the same folder as the  WSBAI.ipynb file, training and evaulating should run smoothly.
